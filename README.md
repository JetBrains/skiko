# Kotlin Multiplatform library for Skia and window management #

Skiko (short for Skia for Kotlin) is the graphical library exposing significant part
of [Skia library](https://skia.org) APIs to Kotlin, along with the gluing code for rendering context.
At the moment, Linux(x86_64 and arm64), Windows(x86_64) and macOS(x86_64 and arm64) builds for Kotlin/JVM are available.

## Using as dependency

To use in build scripts one has to compute appropriate target platform and version,
i.e. something like this

```kotlin
    repositories {
        maven("https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/compose/dev")
    }

    val osName = System.getProperty("os.name")
    val targetOs = when {
        osName == "Mac OS X" -> "macos"
        osName.startsWith("Win") -> "windows"
        osName.startsWith("Linux") -> "linux"
        else -> error("Unsupported OS: $osName")
    }

    val osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch")
    var targetArch = when (osArch) {
        "x86_64", "amd64" -> "x64"
        "aarch64" -> "arm64"
        else -> error("Unsupported arch: $osArch")
    }

    val version = "0.4.12"
    val target = "${targetOs}-${targetArch}"
    dependencies {
        implementation("org.jetbrains.skiko:skiko-jvm-runtime-$target:$version")
    }
```

To use latest development snapshot use version `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

## Building JVM bindings

* Set JAVA_HOME to location of JDK, at least version 11
* `cd skiko && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` will build the artefact and publish it to local Maven repo

To build with debug symbols and debug Skia build use `-Pskiko.debug=true` Gradle argument.

#### Working with Skia sources

Gradle build downloads the necessary version of Skia by default.
However, if downloaded sources are modified, changes are discarded (Gradle
re-evaluates tasks, when outputs are changed).
To use custom version of the dependencies, specify `SKIA_DIR` environment variable.

#### Building on Windows

##### Using Visual Studio C++
* Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) or
[Visual Studio C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).
* If Gradle fails to find Visual C++ toolchain:
```
Execution failed for task ':compileDebugWindowsCpp'.
> No tool chain is available to build C++ for host operating system 'Windows 10' architecture 'x86-64':
    - Tool chain 'visualCpp' (Visual Studio):
        - Could not locate a Visual Studio installation, using the command line tool, Windows registry or system path.
```
set `SKIKO_VSBT_PATH` environment variable to the location of installed Visual Studio Build Tools. 
This could be done in the UI:
```
Control Panel|All Control Panel Items|System|Advanced system settings|Environment variables
```
or by running `cmd` as administrator:
```
setx /M SKIKO_VSBT_PATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools"
```
